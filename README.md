Expanded shopping cart application using object-oriented Python and a menu-driven interface.‚Äù

Online Shopping Cart (Module 6 Portfolio Milestone)

This project is a continuation of the Module 4 Portfolio Milestone and demonstrates a complete object-oriented Python program that simulates an online shopping cart system.

## Features
- Two custom classes: `ItemToPurchase` and `ShoppingCart`
- Menu-driven interface using a `print_menu()` function
- Methods to add, remove, and modify items in the cart
- Output functions to display total cost and item descriptions
- Parameterized constructors and structured program design
- Input validation using `.strip()` to clean user input

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your name and the current date.
3. Use the menu options to manage your shopping cart.
4. Type `q` to quit the program.

## Learning Objectives Demonstrated
- Class creation and object instantiation
- Method scope and class interaction
- Looping and conditional logic
- Clean code structure and modular programming

This project was completed as part of CSC500: Principles of Programming at CSU Global.
